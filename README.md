# Translator Application with Google Translate

This is a simple translator application built using Python and the Google Translate API (`googletrans`). The application allows users to enter text, select a target language, and translate the text into the chosen language. It also provides the pronunciation of the translated text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `translator.py` script using Python.
   ```bash
   python translator.py
   ```
   This will open the Translator GUI window.

2. Enter the text you want to translate in the "Enter text" field.

3. Select the target language from the dropdown menu labeled "to Language".

4. Click the "Translate" button to see the translated text in the "translated text" field.

5. The pronunciation of the translated text will be displayed in the "pronunciation" field.

## Notes

- Make sure you have an active internet connection as the application relies on the Google Translate API for translations.
- The translation may not be 100% accurate, especially for complex sentences or idiomatic expressions.
